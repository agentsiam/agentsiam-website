/**
 * Builds src/lib/guide.generated.ts from the Lotus House Sites & Tips sheet.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF `prebuild`
 *
 * The photo manifest runs before every build because it only reads the local disk.
 * This one talks to Google Sheets, Google Maps and a routing service, so making it a
 * build step would mean a deploy fails whenever a third party is slow, rate-limits us,
 * or Nils has the sheet open in a state that will not export. Instead its output and
 * its cache are both committed, and this is run by hand when the guide changes:
 *
 *     npm run guide
 *
 * A Vercel build therefore does no network work for the guide at all. It reads a
 * checked-in TypeScript file, which is also why the guide still renders if the sheet
 * is ever deleted.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHEET IS AND IS NOT
 *
 * The sheet is today's input, not infrastructure this repo commits to. src/lib/guide.
 * generated.ts is the guide's source of truth (CLAUDE.md R11); the sheet is a free
 * resource Paul happens to share to enrich it, spent once its rows are merged in and
 * the guide is regenerated. Nothing here re-fetches it on a schedule or expects it to
 * stay in sync -- the next enrichment may be a different sheet entirely, a different
 * kind of source, or a direct edit to this file's own inputs. A row still never carries
 * a hand-typed coordinate; this script resolves the Google Maps link once and remembers
 * it in scripts/guide-cache.json, keyed by link, so a rerun only touches rows that are
 * actually new.
 *
 * The sheet stores distances hardcoded to Lotus House. Those columns are deliberately
 * NOT imported. Walking and driving times are routed from each property's public start
 * point, a guide place near the house named in src/lib/guide-start.ts, and cached the same
 * way. Never from the house: the times sit next to every place's exact coordinate, and
 * times measured from the door can be worked back to the door. Paul, 08/11/2026. This
 * script does not read the house coordinates at all.
